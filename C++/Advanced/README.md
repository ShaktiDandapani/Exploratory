# Purpose

To understand C++ a bit more in depth, 
as we have covered the basics an 
understanding can be garnered from 
a much deeper perspective in terms 
of :
1. Programming Paradigms
2. How building blocks of the language
   can be compounded into complete 
   tools to achieve targets which 
   require a lot more than just 
   the basics.
3. Help myself gather the knowledge 
   wherewithal, so as to develop 
   useful tools and gain further 
   enlightenment :P

## Resources

The concepts and code written here 
will be a mixture of standard book
knowledge, web resources etc. 
which I will list down here as I
keep updating my own awareness.
