# Root 

A few folders are made for different programming languages,
sub folders are present with their own READMEs to describe
their presence and utility.

## Note
Shifted to windows for a while.

### Updates 15.04.2020

1. Utilising cmake to build projects
2. Helping organise projects and understand CI.

please note: 

the build command used for cmake here is:

1. at the folder with the top level CMakeLists.txt
2. execute in cmd line the following
   1. cmake -S . -B build
   2. cmake --build build

The folders and files can be accessed and build run from

that directory with . or .. or any other desired method,

I have chosen to use a build directory currently.
