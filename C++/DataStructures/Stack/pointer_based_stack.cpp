#include <iostream>


/* Basic functions in a stack

   a. empty
   b. size
   c. back
   d. push
   e. pop

   we use a stack which dynamically adjusts
   its size when a new element is added and 
   removed :)

   LIFO

   bear in mind we are using an int stack for now
   for template based stack we can use T etc..
