# Purpose

Learning the standard library functions, classes etc.


# # Parallels to Python
-----------------------

Given my exposure to various libraries in Python, 
and having an understanding of their utility.

It is of interest to understand if similar
capabilities can be found in C++ and also 
learn about functionalities not present in Python.
