# An exploratory code base, beginning with C++ 
----------------------------------------------

## Basics Folder
The basics section examples are derived from:
https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/object-class

## Library STL Folder
A look into a few standard libraries, based 
on a few tutorials from online websites 
and based on personal interest.

## Algorithms C++ Folder
Well a lot of folders within this one,
implementation and testing using c++
fundamentals is key to understanding 
their function, performance and use 
cases.

## Problems Folder
Solving problems as seen on various
coding websites, challenges etc.

## Peronsal Interest Folders
Upcoming code base of a few 
independent projects I undertake 
based on my domain interest, combined
with knowledge of the sphere and a 
realisation of ideas into software.
